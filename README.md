# Cryptography Algorithms Simulations 

This repo contains simulations that I coded up for various encryption algorithms.
These algorithms are essential in transferring files securely in this day and age.

A good resource for the unfamiliar: https://www.practicalnetworking.net/practical-tls/rsa-diffie-hellman-dsa-asymmetric-cryptography-explained/

## Coded simulations
